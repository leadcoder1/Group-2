Current Education
My current education is ongoing as I am a Year 11 studying studying ATAR subjects of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics Methods, English, and Music Craft. My nationality is Australian, however my background heritage is half-Italian and half-Australian. I was actually born in Germany, as my father was a postdoctoral researcher in a small German town called Göttingen. My hobbies are programming and game develooping, playing the flute, long distance running, and cycling. I have two dogs, one a Border Collie and the other a Miniature Schnauzer and I spend my time outside of school either running or gaming. I recently ran a 13 km trail run race through the John Forrest National Park, in Perth, Western Australia.

Interest in IT
My Interest in IT centres around computer programming, primarily because I can create programs which can be used to perform specific tasks for user’s needs so that their goals can be achieved in the easiest way for them to complete their task. I am also interested in new technology, especially new advances in computer hardware and software.
My interest in IT really started at the beginning of high school because I was shown how technology has advanced over the years and I wanted to contribute to this evolution. My high school has a 1:1 device policy, so we use IT and computer solutions daily in my studies.
One particular event that sparked my interest in IT was a careers expo that was held at my school. I wandered to the section that was talking about careers in IT and from what I saw I was intrigued by how the virtual world has progressed so much due to augmented and virtual realities. This sparked my interest as I wanted to contribute to developing this type of technology as It has a lot of potential to giving people more entertainment as well as a more interactive workstyle.
IT Experience
The experience I have in IT to date is in terms of Programming. I am able to program in several languages, such as C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, HTML 5. I also have experience with Game Development, using development platforms or game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
I chose to study at RMIT because I wanted to further increase my understanding of technology and ways in which I can use it to apply for careers once I have finished my studies.
What do you expect to learn during your studies?
From my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn more about the field of IT such as programming, cybersecurity and networking.
